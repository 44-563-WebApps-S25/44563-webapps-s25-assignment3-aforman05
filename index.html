        <h3> Peanut Butter Chicken </h3>
        <p>
            My favorite food is <b>peanut butter chicken</b> because I like eating food with a lot of <b>protein</b>. I also like this dish because it tastes like peanut butter and not so much like chicken. Finally, it's <b>not very expensive</b>.
